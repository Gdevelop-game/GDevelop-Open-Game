# Contribution Guide

Thank you for contributing to the repository! Have fun coding and meeting new friends!

### Instructions
Master branch is protected, impossible to push there without making a Pull Request.
There are two ways to contribute to the repository:
- fork the repository on GitHub, write your code on the fork, then open a Pull Request to the original repository; our maintainers will review and merge the edits;
- or, join our Discord Server (link below) and ask our maintainer arthuro555 to add you to the organization in GitHub, so you can push to any branch, other than `master`.

Easy, and simple!
