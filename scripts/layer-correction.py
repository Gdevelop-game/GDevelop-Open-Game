#   This is a simple script to fix z-layers on objects.
#   This will set all objects to an established "correct" height,
#   ensuring that we aren't getting objects with a Z Order of 12643524.
#
#   To run this script, invoke it from the root of the repo as such:
#   $ python3 scripts/layer-correction.py src/layouts/{scene}.json
#   For example:
#   $ python3 scripts/layer-correction.py src/layouts/city.json
#   This will generate a new version of the file in the root of the repo.
#   You can then copy this file into the layouts folder.
