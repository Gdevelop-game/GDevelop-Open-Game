This Repository is an Attempt to create a GTA-like game using **GDevelop 5** game engine. The name is likely to change later on. Moereover,
we are likely to work in teams rather than individually so your performance/contribution will be a major factor.

### Trying the game out

The game is being automatically built on every commit to master. Try it out here: [GDevelop Open Game Preview](https://gdevelop-game.github.io/GDevelop-Open-Game).  
To download the pc version, go on [github actions's auto build workflow](https://github.com/Gdevelop-game/GDevelop-Open-Game/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Auto+Build%22), click on the commit of your choice and press artifacts to download the builds.
